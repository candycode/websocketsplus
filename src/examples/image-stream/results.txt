Hardware/Software configuration not relevant, same speed obtained
on a mix of 2008 to 2012 desktops/laptops running Mac OS and Linux.

Firefox: 45-47 fps!
Chrome: 31-33

Same speed with or without Canvas 2D *BUT*:
- on Firefox Canvas is required to avoid flickering
- Chrome is always much slower than Firefox in any HW/SW configuration
  with or without Canvas 2D

Using the image as the page background does cause a lot of flickering. 
Use Canvas with style="position:fixed; top:0;left:0" instead of background image
 
With Chrome closing the main window is fine but closing a single tab results
in an exception on the server
