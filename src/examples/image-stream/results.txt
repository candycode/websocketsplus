Hardware/Software configuration not relevant, same speed obtained
on a mix of 2008 to 2012 desktops/laptops running Mac OS and Linux.

With jpeg:

Firefox: 45-47 fps!
Chrome: 31-33

Same speed with or without Canvas 2D *BUT*:
- on Firefox Canvas is required to avoid flickering
- Chrome is always much slower than Firefox in any HW/SW configuration
  with or without Canvas 2D

Using the image as the page background does cause a lot of flickering. 
Use Canvas with style="position:fixed; top:0;left:0" instead of background
image.
 
With Chrome closing the main window results in an send error on the server.
No problems with Firefox when closing either the program or a tab.

Changing the size of the canvas doesn't affect the performance.

Using PNG instead of JPEG I get better fps in general.

With large images Firefox always outperforms Chrome by a big margin, e.g. with 
a 4k full quality image: Chrome - 3 fps, Firefox 21 fps.

The best solution to stream 4k images is to use webp (13fps, at max quality or
)

-------------
OPTIMAL SETUP
-------------

All the following data were gathered on a 2008 Linux box with a Penryn class
cpu and an NVIDIA GTX 280 graphics card.
OS is Ubuntu 13.04.

Chrome
------
Background canvas
Webp or jpeg at 50% quality (no noticeable different from uncompressed version,
webp has better quality)
41 fps on a 2008 Linux box with a GTX280 NVIDIA card;
when using two screens I get 39-40 on one and ~35 on the other

with webp
---------
Selecting a quality of 25% reduced the size of 15% compared to 50% quality
and does not increase the fps (~1)

Selecting a quality of 75-80% increases the size by 20% compared to 50% and
does decrease the frame rate to 37-39 from 41-42

A quality of 10% results in frames that are 30% smaller than 50% quality and
an fps count of 43-45

In all cases webp is the fasted to encode the images on the server and decode
on the client

Firefox
-------
Use jpeg with 50-60% quality: 49fps


Using a low quality jpeg is better than a low quality webp.


IN GENERAL: USING A 75-80% jpeg, webp or PNG gives the best results:
38fps on Chrome and >45 on Firefox with size of about < 30% best quality case.

Canvas 2D vs plain img
----------------------

No difference in performance, canvas 2d allows for more flexibility.

With canvas 2d no noticing flickering in both Chrome and Firefox; without
canvas 2d there might be some flickering in Firefox when panning over a large
image.
